## 🎨 Image Optimization Tips

1. **File Format:** Use JPEG (.jpg) for photos - better compression than PNG
2. **File Size:** Keep images under 500KB each for faster loading
   - Use tools like TinyJPG.com or Squoosh.app to compress
3. **Quality:** Balance quality vs file size (80-85% quality is usually perfect)
4. **Aspect Ratios:** Stick to recommended dimensions for best results
5. **Lighting:** Use bright, well-lit photos when possible

## 📝 How to Add Images

1. Save your photos with the exact file names listed above
2. Place them in this `images/` folder
3. The website will automatically display them
4. If you don't want to use certain images, you can:
   - Remove the image reference from `content.js`
   - Or simply don't add that image file (the site will gracefully hide missing images)

## 🔄 Updating Images

To change an image:
1. Replace the existing file with a new one using the same filename
2. Or update the filename in `content.js` to point to a different file

## ✨ Optional Images

All images are optional! If you don't add a specific image:
- Hero will show the elegant gradient background instead
- Detail cards will show just the icons
- Story section will show just text
- The site will still look beautiful
